# slide_game

slide_game (name subject to change) is (supposed to become) a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to move your character to the goal by placing tiles with different actions (such as move in a specified direction) on a board.

Play by selecting New Game from the game menu. Left click to place a tile, right click to remove. Scroll the mouse wheel to cycle through the different tiles (this may be difficult with a touchpad - button implementation or another solution is to be expected). To start the simulation, select Play from the game menu. The simulation can be paused by selecting Stop in the menu.

## Build Instructions

- Java version: 9
- Libraries: JavaFX
- **IMPORTANT: The application runs from GameGUI, not Main.** This will most likely be changed later.
