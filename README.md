# slide_game

slide_game [name subject to change] is (supposed to become) a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to move your character to the goal by placing tiles with different actions (such as move in a specified direction) on a board.

Play by selecting New Game from the game menu. Left click to place a tile, right click to remove. To start the simulation, select Play from the game menu. The simulation can be paused by selecting Stop in the menu.
