# slide_game

slide_game (name subject to change) is (supposed to become) a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to move your character to the goal by placing tiles with different actions (such as move in a specified direction) on a board.

Play by selecting New slide_game.Game from the game menu. Left click to place a tile, right click to remove. Scroll the mouse wheel or press the space button to cycle through the different tiles. To start the simulation, select Play from the game menu. The simulation can be paused by selecting slide_game.tile_actionstop in the menu.
